{"name":"Chef Cookbooks for Mac OS X","tagline":"Automate all the things on your workstation","body":"## You've automated your servers. Now automate your workstation.\r\n\r\nThis GitHub organization contains various cookbooks targeted at [Chef](https://getchef.com/) users who want to automate their Mac OS X workstations. It was inspired by Pivotal's [Sprout](https://github.com/pivotal-sprout/sprout) project, but Sprout assumes you want to manage your workstation using Chef Solo running under your user ID. The cookbooks & recipes in here have no such restriction; it assumes you want to run Chef Client as root, possibly as a `launchd` daemon.\r\n\r\n## What this project does not contain\r\n\r\nCookbooks out in the community that already have cross-platform support, including for Mac OS X, are not included here. This organization's repositories contain, and will continue to contain, *only* cookbooks that work exclusively on Mac OS X.\r\n\r\n## Related cookbooks\r\n\r\nBesides Pivotal Sprout, there are lots of great community cookbooks used to set up other aspects of your Mac OS X system. Some of them are used here as dependencies. Among them:\r\n\r\n* [dmg](http://ckbk.it/dmg), for managing and installing applications off DMGs\r\n* [mac_os_x](http://ckbk.it/mac_os_x), some LWRPs for managing plist files\r\n* [xquartz](http://ckbk.it/xquartz), for installing XQuartz (X11)\r\n* [1password](http://ckbk.it/1password), for installing the 1Password password manager\r\n* [iterm2](http://ckbk.it/iterm2), for replacing your Terminal with iTerm2\r\n\r\n## Authors and Contributors\r\n\r\nThis project was started by [@juliandunn](https://github.com/juliandunn/), who works at [Chef](https://www.getchef.com/). Contributions are welcome! If you have an OS X-exclusive cookbook that you no longer wish to maintain, or want others to help collaborate with outside of your personal GitHub namespace, please get in touch and we can talk about getting it transferred here.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nMost cookbooks are Apache 2.0-licensed.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
