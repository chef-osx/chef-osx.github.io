<p>This GitHub organization contains various cookbooks targeted at <a href="https://getchef.com/">Chef</a> users who want to automate their Mac OS X workstations. It was inspired by Pivotal's <a href="https://github.com/pivotal-sprout/sprout">Sprout</a> project, but Sprout assumes you want to manage your workstation using Chef Solo running under your user ID. The cookbooks &amp; recipes in here have no such restriction; it assumes you want to run Chef Client as root, possibly as a <code>launchd</code> daemon.</p>

<a name="what-this-project-does-not-contain" class="anchor" href="#what-this-project-does-not-contain"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What this project does not contain</h2>

<p>Cookbooks out in the community that already have cross-platform support, including for Mac OS X, are not included here. This organization's repositories contain, and will continue to contain, <em>only</em> cookbooks that work exclusively on Mac OS X.</p>
